## a) Problem Statement
With over 9000km of roads in Singapore today (and counting), monitoring accidents and ensuring the safety of road users is an increasingly difficult task which neccesitates a large amount of manpower.

Our group aims to increase the efficiency of staff monitoring the camera feeds as well as flag out dangerous driving activity that might not be noticed by an operator. We do so by flagging and detection of 2 things - (1) accidents/road incidents and (2) dangerous driving behaviour, including drink driving, falling asleep at the wheel, aggressive driving etc. We hope that this system would lead to faster response to incidents and possible prediction of accidents.
