**Automated Realtime Traffic Surveillance System**

Team Emanmaet: Chuah Jin Wei, Lim Jit Wei, Chong Khe Yang, Lim Shuen

## a) Problem Statement
Our group aims to increase the efficiency and reduce the workload of staff monitoring the camera feed as well as flag out dangerous driving activity that might not be noticed by an operator. We do so by flagging and detection of 2 things - (1) accidents/road incidents and (2) dangerous driving behaviour, including drink driving, falling asleep at the wheel, aggressive driving etc. We hope that this system would lead to faster response to incidents and possible prediction of accidents.
